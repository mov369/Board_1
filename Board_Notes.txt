Things to consider when choosing a motor:

RPM:
To get the RPM from a BLDC motor, look at the KV rating.
KV x Voltage = RPM
(e.g. If we want 26000 RPM, and we have a battery that supplies 20V, we need a motor with a KV rating 1300) 


ESC (Electronic Speed Controller):
Should match the Motor and the Battery.
Likely Will need a servo control signal to fine adjust the speed.
